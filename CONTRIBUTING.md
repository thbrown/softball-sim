# Softball Lineup Optimizer Contributing

Hello! Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Softball Lineup Optimizer.

I'm happy to approve pull requests that add new lineup optimizer algorithms or that add new lineup types. See the sections below for instructions on how do each of these. If you'd like to change something else, lets talk before you do too much work since this may affect the softball.app web application that uses this repo and I'll need to make sure your changes are compatible.

A note on code style. This repo generally follows the Google Style Guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) with some changes to line length and enum formatting. Once you've made your changes, you can import the code-format.xml into your IDE and do your formatting there or just run `./gradlew spotlessApply` to auto format all Java code in the project.

## Add a Lineup Optimizer Algorithm

The default optimizer is fine, but I have a better algorithm for lineup optimization that [uses cutting edge machine learning, is endorsed by Tony La Russa, accounts for relativistic effects, etc...] Great! Add your own optimizer by following these steps:

1. Create a JSON definition file for your optimizer and put it in the `<project_root>/docs/definitions` directory. The name of this file should be in the form `<numerical_id>.json`. For `<numerical_id>` use next available integer number. TODO: Doc the json schema
1. Create a *.md description file in `/docs/descriptions` with a detailed description of your optimizer, and the philosophy behind it. You'll need to reference this description file in your JSON definition file under the key "longDescriptionFile". In addition to standard markdown you can used [katex](https://katex.org/) blocks for math formulas and [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) blocks for some types of charts.
1. Create a new Java package for your Optimizer named `com.github.thbrown.softballsim.optimizer.impl.<your_optimizer_name>`. All the Java for your implementation should go in this package or in packages below this one (i.e. `...mizer.impl.<your_optimizer_name>.<your_subpackage>` is fine).
1. Create a class that implements the Optimizer interface. Optimizer is a generic type so you'll need to specify a `Result` class. If your Optimizer implementation produces data other than an optimized lineup and an estimated score, you'll need to create your own subclass of Result. If not, you can just use the existing Result class. See the Java doc on the relevant classes for additional help.
1. Make an enum value for your optimizer in com.github.thbrown.softballsim.optimizer.OptimizerEnum. The enum constructor accepts an id (this id should match the number used in the name of your JSON definition file) and an instance of your Optimizer implementation.
1. Run all the tests `./gradlew clean test --info` and fix any failures.
1. Re-generate the index.html for the gallery `./gradlew generateGalleryHtml`.
1. Open `<project_root>/docs/index.html` in your browser and make sure your entry in the gallery looks the way you like it.  Alternatively, Run the built-in Gradle web-server `./gradlew serve` and checkout `http://localhost:8085/index.html` in your browser.
1. Format your code `./gradlew spotlessApply` (`./gradlew build` will also format code as part of the build process)

## Add a LineupType

Different leagues and tournaments have different rules for how lineups can be constructed. If the simulator doesn't support the format your team uses, consider adding a new lineupType by following these steps:

To add a new lineup type:

1. Create a class that implements LineupIndexer in the package `com.github.thbrown.softballsim.lineupindexer`.
   - LineupIndexer retrieves the set of all valid BattingLineups by index. Implement your new lineup indexer such that it only returns BattingLineups that are valid according to your lineup rules.
   - In the strage case that your lineup can't be represented by a list of players for functional purposes, you'll need to add a new BattingLineup implementation as well. If you do so, you'll still need to provide a way to represent your lineup as a list for display purposes. The BattingLineup interface enforces this.
1. If you added a new LineupIndexer, register your new indexer in the static map in the LineupType class.
1. Run all the tests `./gradlew clean test --info` and fix any failures.
1. Format your code `./gradlew spotlessApply` (`./gradlew build` will also format code)
