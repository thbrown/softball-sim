  "shortDescription": "A faster but less accurate optimizer that doesn't test the entire search space of possible lineups. Instead, it employs [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) to seaerch only a subset of possible lineups. If you have 11 or more batters in your lineup, this is most likely the optimizer you'll want to use.",
